# Start by writing an algorithm that picks a random unexplored direction from the player's current room, travels and logs that direction, then loops. This should cause your player to walk a depth-first traversal. When you reach a dead-end (i.e. a room with no unexplored paths), walk back to the nearest room that does contain an unexplored path.

# You can find the path to the shortest unexplored room by using a breadth-first search for a room with a `'?'` for an exit. If you use the `bfs` code from the homework, you will need to make a few modifications.

# 1. Instead of searching for a target vertex, you are searching for an exit with a `'?'` as the value. If an exit has been explored, you can put it in your BFS queue like normal.

# 2. BFS will return the path as a list of room IDs. You will need to convert this to a list of n/s/e/w directions before you can add it to your traversal path.

# If all paths have been explored, you're done!
